    - Hello, my travelling friend!
    - My name is Froggy, and I'm here to share with you an unpleasant story about
      our old friends, the robots.
    - Did you see those poor robots who were badly injured?
    - Yes, there they are... they were our support workers, cute and adorable.
    - But now they're... they're lying broken, their wires bending around and their
      sensors glowing red nervously.
    - My request to you, traveller, is that you help me fix these poor robots.
    - Use these parts to fix this robot, to paraphrase.
    - I may be able to support you in your future journey or even find you some useful
      allies.
